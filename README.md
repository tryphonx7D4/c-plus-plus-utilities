# CPP-Utilities
My own utility library.

The property header hold the regular and const property classes together with other property-specific classes and structs made for the accessors.
The property and const property test file was only tested for the C++14, C++17 and C++20 standards and only on MSVC.

The other files in this repository are a macro header that holds needed macros, a basic_error class header which has an explanation on why it exists in a comment in the file itself and
a miscellaneous header which I intend to use for various things if I choose to implement other stuff.

That's about it.
